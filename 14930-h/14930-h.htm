<h2>THE TIPTOES.</h2>
<h3>A SKETCH.</h3>
<div class="note">
<p>"The Wrongheads have been a considerable family ever since
England was England."</p>
<p class="rgt">VANBRUGH.</p>
</div>
<div class="dropcap"><a href="images/012-01.png"><img src=

<p><span class="hide">M</span>orning and evening, from every
village within three or four miles of the metropolis, may be
remarked a tide of young men wending diurnal way to and from their
respective desks and counters in the city, preceded by a ripple of
errand-boys, and light porters, and followed by an ebb of plethoric
elderly gentlemen in drab gaiters. Now these individuals
compose&mdash;for the most part&mdash;that particular, yet
indefinite class of people, who call themselves
&ldquo;gentlemen,&rdquo; and are called by everybody else
&ldquo;persons.&rdquo; They are a body&mdash;the advanced
guard&mdash;of the &ldquo;Tiptoes;&rdquo; an army which invaded us
some thirty years ago, and which, since that time, has been
actively and perseveringly spoiling and desolating our modest,
quiet, comfortable English homes, turning our parlours into
&ldquo;boudoirs,&rdquo; ripping our fragrant patches of roses into
fantastic &ldquo;parterres,&rdquo; covering our centre tables with
albums and wax flowers, and, in short (for these details pain us),
stripping our nooks and corners of the welcome warm air of pleasant
homeliness, which was wont to be a charm and a privilege, to
substitute for it a chilly gloss&mdash;an unwholesome straining
after effect&mdash;a something less definite in its operation than
in its result, which is called&mdash;gentility.</p>
<p>To have done with simile. Our matrons have discovered that
luxury is specifically cheaper than comfort (and they regard them
as independent, if not incompatible terms); and more than this,
that comfort is, after all, but an irrelevant and dispensable
corollary to gentility, while luxury is its main prop and stay.
Furthermore, that improvidence is a virtue of such lustre, that
itself or its likeness is essential to the very existence of
respectability; and, by carrying out this proposition, that in
order to make the least amount of extravagance produce the utmost
admiration and envy, it is desirable to be improvident as publicly
as possible; the means for such expenditure being gleaned from
retrenchments in the home department. Thus, by a system of domestic
alchemy, the education of the children is resolved into a vehicle;
a couple of maids are amalgamated into a man in livery; while to a
single drudge, superintended and aided by the mistress and elder
girls, is confided the economy of the pantry, from whose meagre
shelves are supplied supplementary blondes and kalydors.</p>
<p>Now a system of economy which can induce a mother to
&ldquo;bring up her children at home,&rdquo; while she regards a
phaeton as absolutely necessary to convey her to church and to her
tradespeople, and an annual visit to the sea-side as perfectly
indispensable to restore the faded complexions of Frances and
Jemima, ruined by late hours and hot cream, may be considered open
to censure by the philosopher who places women (and girls,
<em>i.e.</em> unmarried women) in the rank of responsible or even
rational creatures. But in this disposition he would be clearly
wrong. Before venturing to define the precise capacity of either an
individual or a class, their own opinion on the subject should
assuredly be consulted; and we are quite sure that there is not one
of the lady Tiptoes who would not recoil with horror from the
suspicion of advancing or even of entertaining an idea&mdash;it
having been ascertained that everything original (sin and all) is
quite inconformable with the feminine character&mdash;unless indeed
it be a method of finding the third side of a turned silk&mdash;or
of defining that zero of fortune, to stand below which constitutes
a &ldquo;detrimental.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Misses Tiptoe are an indefinite number of young ladies, of
whom it is commonly remarked that some may have been pretty, and
others may, hereafter, be pretty. But they never <em>are</em> so;
and, consequently, they are very fearful of being eclipsed by their
dependents, and take care to engage only ill-favoured governesses,
and (but &lsquo;tis an old pun) very plain cooks. The great
business of their lives is fascination, and in its pursuit they are
unremitting. It is divided in distinct departments, among the
sisters; each of whom is characterised at home by some laudatory
epithet, strikingly illustrative of what they would like to be.
There is Miss Tiptoe, such an amiable girl! that is, she has a
large mouth, and a Mallan in the middle of it. There is Jemima,
&ldquo;who enjoys such delicate health &ldquo;&mdash;<em>that</em>
is, she has no bust, and wears a scarf. Then there is Grace, who is
all for evening rambles, and the &ldquo;Pilgrim of Love;&rdquo; and
Fanny, who can <em>not</em> help talking; and whom, in its turn,
talking certainly cannot help. They are remarkable for doing a
little of everything at all times. Whether it be designing on
worsted or on bachelors&mdash;whether concerting overtures musical
or matrimonial; the same pretty development of the shoulder through
that troublesome scarf&mdash;the same hasty confusion in drawing it
on again, and referring to the watch to see what time it
is&mdash;displays the mind ever intent on the great object of their
career. But they seldom marry (unless, in desperation, their
cousins), for they despise the rank which they affect to have
quitted&mdash;and no man of sense ever loved a Tiptoe. So they
continue at home until the house is broken up; and then they retire
in a galaxy to some provincial Belle Vue-terrace or Prospect-place;
where they endeavour to forestall the bachelors with promiscuous
orange-blossoms and maidenly susceptibilities. We have
characterised these heart-burning efforts after
&ldquo;station,&rdquo; as originating with, and maintained by, the
female branches of the family; and they are so&mdash;but,
nevertheless, their influence on the young men is no less
destructive than certain. It is a fact, that, the more restraint
that is inflicted on these individuals in the gilded drawing-room
at home, the more do they crave after the unshackled enjoyment of
their animal vulgarity abroad. Their principal characteristics are
a love of large plaids, and a choice vocabulary of popular
idiomatic forms of speech; and these will sufficiently define them
in the saloons of the theatres and in the cigar divans. But they
are not ever thus. By no means. At home (which does not naturally
indicate their own house), having donned their &ldquo;other
waistcoat&rdquo; and their pin (emblematic of a blue hand grasping
an egg, or of a butterfly poised on a wheel)&mdash;pop! they are
<em>gentlemen</em>. With the hebdomadal sovereign straggling in the
extreme verge of their pockets&mdash;with the afternoon rebuke of
the &ldquo;principal,&rdquo; or peradventure of some senior clerk,
still echoing in their ears&mdash;they are GENTLEMEN. They are
desired to be such by their mother and sisters, and so they talk
about cool hundreds&mdash;and the points of horses&mdash;and (on
the strength of the dramatic criticisms in the <em>Satirist</em>)
of Grisi in <em>Norma</em>, and Persiani in <em>La
Sonnambula</em>&mdash;of Taglioni and Cerito&mdash;of last season
and the season before that.</p>
<p>We know not how far the readers of PUNCH may be inclined to
approve so prosy an article as this in their pet periodical; but we
have ventured to appeal to them (as the most sensible people in the
country) against a class of shallow empirics, who have managed to
glide unchidden into our homes and our families, to chill the one
and to estrange the other. Surely, surely, we were unworthy of our
descent, could we see unmoved our lovely English girls, whose
modesty was wont to be equalled only by their beauty, concentrating
all their desires and their energies on a good match; or our
reverend English matrons, the pride and honour of the land,
employing themselves in the manufacture of fish-bone blanc-mange
and mucilaginous tipsy-cakes; or our young Englishmen, our hope and
our resource, spending themselves in the debasing contamination of
cigars and alcohol.</p>

<h3>TAKING THE HODDS.</h3>
<p>On a recent visit of Lord Waterford to the &ldquo;Holy
Land,&rdquo; then to sojourn in the hostel or caravansera of the
protecting <em>Banks</em> of that classic ground, that interesting
young nobleman adopted, as the seat of his precedency, a Brobdignag
hod, the private property of some descendant from one of the
defunct kings of Ulster; at the close of an eloquent harangue; his
lordship expressed an earnest wish that he should be able to
continue</p>

<h2>ROEBUCK DEFYING THE &ldquo;THUNDERER.&rdquo;</h2>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">Roebuck was seated in his great arm chair,</p>
<p class="i6">Looking as senatorial and wise</p>
<p class="i6">As a calf&rsquo;s head, when taken in surprise;</p>
<p class="i2">A half-munch&rsquo;d muffin did his fingers
bear&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">An empty egg-shell proved his meal nigh
o&rsquo;er.</p>
<p class="i2">When, lo! there came a tapping at the door:</p>
<p class="i6">&ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; he cried,</p>
<p class="i6">And in another minute by his side</p>
<p class="i2">Stood John the footboy, with the morning paper,</p>
<p class="i2">Wet from the press. O&rsquo;er Roebuck&rsquo;s
cheek</p>
<p class="i4">There passed a momentary gleam of joy,</p>
<p class="i2">Which spoke, as plainly as a smile could speak,</p>
<p class="i4">&ldquo;Your master&rsquo;s speech is in that paper,
boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="i2">He waved his hand&mdash;the footboy left the
room&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">Roebuck pour&rsquo;d out a cup of Hyson bloom;</p>
<p class="i2">And, having sipp&rsquo;d the tea and sniff&rsquo;d
the vapour,</p>
<p class="i2">Spread out the &ldquo;Thunderer&rdquo; before his
eyes&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">When, to his great surprise,</p>
<p class="i2">He saw imprinted there, in black and white,</p>
<p class="i4">That he, THE ROE-buck&mdash;HE, whom all men
knew,</p>
<p class="i2">Had been expressly born to set worlds
right&mdash;</p>
<p class="i4">That HE was nothing but a <em>parvenu</em>.</p>
<p class="i2">Jove! was it possible they lack&rsquo;d the knowledge
he</p>
<p class="i2">Boasted a literary and scientific genealogy!</p>
<p class="i2">That he had had some ancestors before him&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">(Beside the Pa who wed the Ma who bore
him)&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">Men whom the world had slighted, it is true,</p>
<p class="i6">Because it never knew</p>
<p class="i2">The greatness of the genius which had lain,</p>
<p class="i2">Like unwrought ore, within each vasty brain;</p>
<p class="i2">And as a prejudice exists that those</p>
<p class="i2">Who never do disclose</p>
<p class="i2">The knowledge that they boast of, seldom have
any,</p>
<p class="i2">Each of his learned ancestors had died,</p>
<p class="i2">By an ungrateful world belied,</p>
<p class="i2">And dubb&rsquo;d a Zany.</p>
<p class="i6">That HE should be</p>
<p class="i6">Denied a pedigree!</p>
<p class="i2">Appeared so monstrous in this land of freedom,</p>
<p class="i2">He instantly conceived the notion</p>
<p class="i2">To go down to the House and make a motion,</p>
<p class="i2">That all men had a right to those who breed
&lsquo;em.</p>

<p class="i2">Just like an ace of hearts,</p>

<p class="i2">He rises--members blow their noses,</p>

<p>He speaks:&mdash;</p>

<h3>EXPRESS FROM WINDSOR.</h3>
<p>Last evening a most diabolical, and, it is to be regretted
successful, attempt, was made to kiss the Princess Royal. It
appears that the Royal Babe was taking an airing in the park,
reclining in the arms of her principal nurse, and accompanied by
several ladies of the court, who were amusing the noble infant by
playing rattles, when a man of ferocious appearance emerged from
behind some trees, walked deliberately up to the noble group,
placed his hands on the nurse, and bent his head over the Princess.
The Honourable Miss Stanley, guessing the ruffian&rsquo;s
intention, earnestly implored him to kiss her instead, in which
request she was backed by all the ladies
present.<sup>1</sup><span class="sidenote">1. This circumstance
alone must at once convince every unprejudiced person of the utter
falsity of the reports (promulgated by certain interested parties)
of the disloyalty of the Tory ladies, when we see several dames
placed in the most imminent danger, yet possessing sufficient
presence of mind to offer <em>lip-service</em> to their
sovereign.&mdash;EDITOR. <em>Morn. Post</em>.</span> He was not,
however, to be frustrated in the attempt, which no sooner had he
accomplished, than he hurried off amidst the suppressed screams of
the ladies. The Royal Infant was immediately carried to the palace,
where her heart-rending cries attracted the attention of her
Majesty, who, on hurrying to the child, and hearing the painful
narration, would, in the burst of her maternal affection, have
kissed the infant, had not Sir J. Clarke, who was fortunately
present, prevented her so doing.</p>
<p>Dr. Locock was sent for from town, who, immediately on his
arrival at Windsor, held a conference with Sir J. Clarke, and a
basin of pap was prepared by them, which being administered to the
Royal Infant, produced the most satisfactory results.</p>
<p>We are prohibited from stating the measures taken for the
detection of the ruffian, lest their disclosure should frustrate
the ends of justice.</p>
<hr />
<h3>A ROYAL DUCK.</h3>
<p>His Royal Highness Prince Albert, during the sojourn of the
Court at Windsor Castle, became, by constant practice in the
Thames, so expert a swimmer, that, with the help of a cork jacket,
he could, like Jones of the celebrated firm of &ldquo;Brown, Jones,
and Robinson,&rdquo; swim &ldquo;anywhere over the river.&rdquo;
Her Majesty, however, with true conjugal regard for the safety of
the royal duck, never permitted him to venture into the water
without</p>

<h2>GREAT ANNUAL MICHAELMAS JUBILEE.</h2>
<h3>MAGNIFICENT CELEBRATION OF GOOSE-DAY.</h3>
<p>How often are we&mdash;George Stephens-like&mdash;to be called
upon to expend our invaluable breath in performing Eolian
operations upon our own cornopean! Here have we, at an enormous
expense and paralysing peril, been obliged to dispatch our most
trusty and well-beloved reporter, to the fens in Lincolnshire,
stuffed with brandy, swathed in flannel, and crammed with jokes;
from whence he, at the cost of infinite pounds, unnumbered
rheumatisms, and a couple of agues, caught, to speak vulgarly,
&ldquo;in a brace of shakes,&rdquo; has forwarded us the following
authentic account of the august proceedings which took place in
that county on the anniversary of the great St. Michaelmas.</p>
<h4>FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.</h4>
<p><em>Tuesday night</em>.&mdash;Depths of the fens&mdash;just
arrived&mdash;only time to state all muck&mdash;live eels and
festivity&mdash;Sibthorp in extra force&mdash;betting 6 to 4
&ldquo;he cooks everybody&rsquo;s goose&rdquo;&mdash;no
takers&mdash;D&rsquo;Israeli says it&rsquo;s a gross want of
sympathy&mdash;full account to-morrow&mdash;expect rare
doings&mdash;must conclude&mdash;whrr-rh-h&mdash;tertian coming
on&mdash;promises great shakes.</p>
<p class="cen">I am, sincerely and shiveringly,</p>
<p class="rgt">YOUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.</p>
<p><em>Wednesday morning</em>.&mdash;The day dawned like a second
deluge, and the various volunteer <em>dramatis person&aelig;</em>
seemed like the spectres of the defunct water-dogs of
Sadler&rsquo;s Wells. An eminent tallow-chandler from the east end
of Whitechapel contracted for the dripping, and report says he
found it a very swimming speculation. Life-preservers, waterproof
and washable hats, were on the ground, which, together with
Macintoshes and corks, formed a pleasing and varied group. The
grand stand was graced by several eminent and capacious geese; nor
was the infantine simplicity of numerous promising young goslings
wanting to complete the delightful <em>ensemble</em>.</p>
<p>The business of the day commenced with a grand commemorative
procession of homage to the prize goose, the representative of
whom, we are proud to say, fell by election to the envied lot of
the gallant, jocose, and <em>Joe Miller</em>tary Colonel
Sibthorp.</p>
<h4>ORDER OF PROCESSION.</h4>
<p class="cen">Trumpeter in Ordinary to &ldquo;all the
geese,&rdquo; and</p>
<p class="cen">himself in particular,</p>
<p class="cen">On his extraordinary Pegasus, beautifully
represented by a Jackass,</p>
<p class="cen">Idealised with magnificent goose&rsquo;s wings.</p>

Identical goose-quill</p>

Alroy,</p>
<p class="cen">Mr. BEN D&rsquo;ISRAELI (much admired).</p>

<p>This imposing procession having reached the grand kitchen, which
had been erected for the occasion, the festivities instantly
commenced by the Vice-Goose, Sir EDWARD LYTTON ERLE BULWER,
proposing the health of the gallant Chairman, the Great-grand
Goose:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman and prize goose,&mdash;The feelings which
now agitate my sensorium on this Michaelmasian occasion stimulate
the vibratetiuncles of the heartiean hypothesis, so as to paralyse
the oracular and articulative apparatus of my loquacious
confirmation, overwhelming my soul-fraught imagination, as the
boiling streams of liquid lava, buried in one vast cinereous
mausoleum&mdash;the palace-crowded city of the engulphed Pompeii.
(<em>Immense cheers</em>.)&mdash;I therefore propose a Methusalemic
elongation of the duration of the vital principle of the presiding
anserian paragon.&rdquo; (<em>Stentorian applause, continued for
half-an-hour after the rising of the Prize Goose</em>) who
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fellow Geese and Goslings,&mdash;Julius C&aelig;sar, when
he laid the first stone of the rock of Gibraltar&mdash;Mr.
Carstairs, the celebrated caligrapher, when he indited the
inscription on the Rosetta stone&mdash;Cleopatra, when she hemmed
Anthony&rsquo;s bandanna with her celebrated needle&mdash;the
Colossus of Rhodes, when he walked and won his celebrated match
against Captain Barclay&mdash;Galileo, when he discovered and
taught his grandmother the mode of sucking eggs&mdash;could not
feel prouder than I do upon the present occasion.
(<em>Cheers</em>.) These reminiscences, I can assure you, will ever
stick in my grateful gizzard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the gallant Colonel sat down, overcome by his feelings and
several glasses of Betts&rsquo; best British brandy.</p>
<p>Song&mdash;&ldquo;Goosey, goosey gander.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. D&rsquo;ISRAELI then rose, and said,&mdash;&ldquo;Chair, and
brethren of the quill, I feel, in assuming the perpendicular, like
the sun when sinking into his emerald bed of western waters.
Overcome by emotions mighty as the impalpable beams of the
harmonious moon&rsquo;s declining light, and forcibly impressed as
the trembling oak, girt with the invisible arms of the gentle
loving zephyr; the blush mantles on my cheek, deep as the
unfathomed depths of the azure ocean. I say, gentlemen, impressed
as I am with a sense&mdash;with a sense, I say, with a
sense&mdash;&rdquo; Here the hon. gentleman sat down for want of a
termination.</p>
<p>Song&mdash;&ldquo;No more shall the children of Judah
sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. PETER BORTHWICK (having corked himself a handsome pair of
mustachios), next rose, and said,&mdash;&ldquo;Most potent, grave,
and reverend signors, and Mr. Chairman,&mdash;if it were done, when
&lsquo;tis done, then &lsquo;twere well it were done
quickly&rsquo;&mdash;in rising to drink&mdash;&lsquo;my custom
always of an afternoon&rsquo;&mdash;the health of Sir Peter Laurie,
and whom I can ask, in the language of the immortal bard,
&lsquo;where gottest thou that goose look,&rsquo; I can only say,
&lsquo;had Heaven made me such another,&rsquo; I would
not&rdquo;&mdash; Then Peter Borthwick sat down, evidently
indisposed, exclaiming&mdash;&ldquo;The drink, Hamlet, the
drink!!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here our reporter left the meeting, who were vociferously
chanting, by way of grace, previous to the attack on the
&ldquo;roast geese,&rdquo; the characteristic anthem of the
&ldquo;King of the Cannibal Islands.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>PUNCH&rsquo;S HISTRIONIC READINGS IN HISTORY.</h2>
<h3>NO. 1.&mdash;ENGLAND.</h3>
<p>Of the early history of England nothing is known. It was,
however, invaded by the <em>Normans</em>; but whether they were any
relations of the once celebrated <em>Norman</em> the pantaloon, we
have no authentic record. The kingdom had at one time seven
kings&mdash;two of whom were probably the two well-known kings of
Brentford. Perhaps, also, the king of Little Britain made a third;
while old king Cole may have constituted a fourth; thus leaving
only a trifling balance of three to be accounted for.</p>
<p>Alfred the Great is supposed to have been originally a baker,
from his having undertaken the task of watching the cakes in the
neat-herd&rsquo;s oven; and Edward the Black Prince was probably a
West Indian, who found his way to our hospitable shores at an early
period.</p>
<p>We now come to King John, who ascended the throne after putting
out his nephew&rsquo;s eyes with a pair of curling-irons, and who
is the first English Sovereign who attempted to write his own name;
for the scrawl is evidently something more than his mark, which is
attached to Magna Charta.</p>
<p>We need say nothing of Richard the Third, with whom all our
play-going friends are familiar, and who made the disgraceful
offer, if Shakspeare is to be believed, of parting with the whole
kingdom for a horse, though it does not appear that the
disreputable bargain was ever completed.</p>
<p>The wars of York and Lancaster, which, though not exactly
<em>couleur de rose</em>, were on the subject of white and red
roses (that is to say, China and cabbage), united the crown in the
person of Henry the Seventh, known to the play-going public as the
Duke of Richmond, and remarkable for having entered the country by
the Lincolnshire fens; for he talks of having got into &ldquo;the
bowels of the land&rdquo; immediately on his arrival.</p>
<p>Henry the Eighth, as everybody knows, was the husband of seven
wives, and gave to Mr. Almar (the Sadler&rsquo;s Wells Stephens)
the idea of his beautiful dramatic poem of the Wife of Seven
Husbands.</p>
<p>Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign is remarkable for having produced a
mantle which is worn at the present day, it having been originally
made for one Shakspeare; but it is now worn by Mr. George Stephens,
for whom, however, it is a palpable misfit, and it sits upon him
most awkwardly.</p>
<p>Charles the First had his head cut off, and Mr. Cathcart acted
him so naturally in Miss Mitford&rsquo;s play that one would have
thought the monarch was entirely without a head all through the
tragedy.</p>
<p>Cromwell next obtained the chief authority. This man was a
brewer, who did not think &ldquo;small beer&rdquo; of himself, and
inundated his country with &ldquo;heavy wet,&rdquo; in the shape of
tears, for a long period.</p>
<p>Charles the Second, well known as the merry monarch, is
remarkable only for his profligacy, and for the number of very bad
farces in which he has been the principal character. His brother
James had a short reign, but not a merry one. He is the only
English sovereign who may be said to have <em>amputated his
bludgeon</em>; which, if we were speaking of an ordinary man and
not a monarch, we should have rendered by the familiar phrase of
&ldquo;cut his stick,&rdquo; a process which was soon performed by
his majesty.</p>
<p>The crown now devolved upon William and Mary, upon whom half-a
crown a-piece was thus settled by the liberality of Parliament.
William was <em>Prince of Orange</em>, a descendant probably of the
great King <em>Pippin</em>.</p>
<p>Anne of Denmark comes next on our list, but of her we shall say
nothing; and as the Georges who followed her are so near own time,
we shall observe, with regard to them, an equally impenetrable
mystery.</p>
<hr />
<h3>WAR TO THE NAIL.</h3>
<p>The <em>British Critic</em>, the high church, in fact, steeple
Tory journal, tells its readers, &ldquo;if we strike out the first
person of Robert&rsquo;s speeches, ay, out of his whole career,
they become a rope untwisted,&rdquo; &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. This
excited old lady is evidently anxious to disfigure the head of the
government, by scratching Sir Robert Peel&rsquo;s I&rsquo;s
out.</p>
<hr />
<h3>MOLAR AND INCISOR.</h3>
<p>Muntz, in rigging Wakley upon the late article in the
<em>Examiner</em>, likening the member for Finsbury, in his
connexion with Sir Robert Peel, &ldquo;to the bird which exists by
picking the crocodile&rsquo;s teeth,&rdquo; jocularly remarked,
&ldquo;Well, I never had any body to pick my teeth.&rdquo; &ldquo;I
should think not, or they would have chosen a much better
set.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>TWENTY POUNDS.</h2>
<p>READER, did you ever want twenty pounds? You have&mdash;you
have!&mdash;I see it&mdash;I know it! Nay, never blush! Your
hand&mdash;your hand!</p>
<p>READER.&mdash;Sir, I&mdash;</p>
<p>Silence!&mdash;nonsense&mdash;stuff; don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t
prevaricate&mdash;own it as I do,&mdash;own it and rejoice.</p>
<p>READER.&mdash;Really, sir, this conduct&mdash;</p>
<p>Is strange. Granted; don&rsquo;t draw back; come, a cordial
gripe. We are friends; we have both suffered from the same cause.
There, that&rsquo;s right&mdash;honest palm to palm. Now, how say
you&mdash;have you ever wanted twenty pounds?</p>
<p>READER.&mdash;Frankly, then, I have.</p>
<p>Mind to mind, as hand to hand. Have you felt as I did? Did its
want cloud the sun, wither the grass, and blight the bud?</p>
<p>READER.&mdash;It did.</p>
<p>But how, marry, how? What! you decline confession&mdash;so you
may&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be more explicit. I was abroad, far from my
&ldquo;father-land&rdquo;&mdash;there&rsquo;s a magic in the
word!&mdash;the turf we&rsquo;ve played on, the hearts we love, the
graves we venerate&mdash;all, all combine to concentrate its
charm.</p>
<p>READER.&mdash;You are digressing.</p>
<p>Thank you, I am; but I&rsquo;ll resume. While I could buy them,
friends indeed were plenty. Alas! prudence is seldom co-mate with
youth and inexperience. The golden dream was soon to end&mdash;end
even with the yellow dross that gave it birth. Fallacious hopes of
coming &ldquo;posts,&rdquo; averted for a time my coming
wretchedness&mdash;three weeks, and not a line! The landlord
suffered from an intermitting affection, characteristic of the
&ldquo;stiff-necked generation;&rdquo;&mdash;he bowed to
others&mdash;galvanism could not have procured the tithe of a
salaam for me. His till was afflicted with a sort of
sinking-fundishness. I was the contractor of &ldquo;the small
bill,&rdquo; whose exact amount would enable him to meet a
&ldquo;heavy payment;&rdquo; my very garments were
&ldquo;tabooed&rdquo; from all earth&rsquo;s decencies; splashes
seemed to have taken a lease of the bottoms of my trousers. My
boots, once objects of the tenderest care of their unworthy
namesake, seemed conscious of the change, and drooped in untreed
wretchedness, desponding at the wretched wrinkles now ruffling the
once smooth calf! My coat no more appeared to catch the dust; as if
under the influence of some invisible charm, its white-washed
elbows never struck upon the sight of the else all-seeing boots;
spider never rushed from his cell with the post-haste speed with
which he issued from his dark recess, to pick the slightest cobweb
that ever harnessed Queen Mab&rsquo;s team, from <em>other</em>
coats; a gnat, a wandering hair left its location, swept by the
angry brush from the broad-cloth of those who paid their
bills&mdash;as far as I was concerned&mdash;all were inoculated
with this strange blindness. It was an overwhelming ophthalmia! The
chambermaid, through its fatality, never discovered that my jugs
were empty, my bottle clothed with slimy green, my soap-dish left
untenanted. A day before this time had been sufficient service for
my hand-towel; now a week seemed to render it less fit to taste the
rubs of hands and soap. Dust lost its vice, and lay unheeded in the
crammed corner of my luckless room.</p>
<p>READER.&mdash;I feel for you.</p>
<p>Silence! the worst is yet to come. At dinner all things
changed&mdash;soup, before too hot to drink, came to my lips cool
as if the north wind had caressed it; number was at an end; I
ranked no longer like a human being; I was a huge
<em>ought</em>&mdash;a walking cypher&mdash;a vile round O. I had
neither beginning nor end. Go where I would&mdash;top, bottom,
sides, &lsquo;twas all the same. Bouilli avoided
me&mdash;vegetables declined growing under my eyes&mdash;fowls fled
from me. I might as well have longed for ice-cream in
Iceland&mdash;dessert in a desert. I had no turn&mdash;I was the
<em>last man</em>. Nevertheless, dinner was a necessary evil.</p>
<p>READER.&mdash;And tea?</p>
<p>Was excluded from the calendar. Night came, but no
rest&mdash;all things had forgotten their office. The sheets
huddled in undisturbed selfishness, like knotted cables, in one
corner of the bed; the blankets, doubtless disgusted at their
conduct, sought refuge at the foot; and the flock, like most other
flocks, without a directing hand, was scattered in disjointed
heaps.</p>
<p>READER.&mdash;Did not you complain?</p>
<p>I did&mdash;<em>imprimis</em>&mdash;to boots&mdash;boots
scratched his head; ditto waiter&mdash;waiter shook his; the
chambermaid, strange to say, was suddenly deaf.</p>
<p>READER.&mdash;And the landlord?</p>
<p>Did nothing all day; but when I spoke, was in a hurry,
&ldquo;going to his ledger,&rdquo; Had I had as many months as
hydra, that would have stopped them all.</p>
<p>READER.&mdash;You were to be <em>pitied</em>.</p>
<p>I was. I rose one morning with the sun&mdash;it scorched my
face, but shone not. Nature was in her spring-time to all others,
though winter to me. I wandered beside the banks of the rapid
Rhine, I saw nothing but the thick slime that clogged them, and
wondered how I could have thought them beautiful; the pebbles
seemed crushed upon the beach, the stream but added to their
lifelessness by heaping on them its dull green slime; the lark,
indeed, was singing&mdash;Juliet was right&mdash;its notes were
nothing but &ldquo;harsh discords and unpleasing
sharps&rdquo;&mdash;a rainbow threw its varied arch across the
heavens&mdash;sadness had robbed it of its charm&mdash;it seemed a
visionary cheat&mdash;a beautiful delusion.</p>
<p>READER.&mdash;I feel with you.</p>
<p>I thank you. I went next day.</p>
<p>READER.&mdash;What then?</p>
<p>The glorious sun shed life and joy around&mdash;the clear water
rushed bounding on in glad delight to the sweet music of the
scented wind&mdash;the pebbly beach welcomed its chaste cool kiss,
and smiled in freshness as it rolled again back to its pristine
bed. The buds on which I stepped, elastic with high hope, sprung
from the ground my foot had pressed them to&mdash;the
lark&mdash;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page137" name="page137"></a>[pg
137]</span>
<p>READER.&mdash;You can say nothing new about that.</p>
<p>You are right. I&rsquo;ll pass it, and come at once to an end.
My boots stood upright, conscious of their glare; a new spring
rushed into my bottles; Flora&rsquo;s sweets were witnessed in my
dress; a mite, a tiny mite, might have made progress round my room,
nor found a substance larger than itself to stop its way. My lips
at dinner were scalded with the steaming soup; the eager waiters,
rushing with the choicest sauce, in dread collision met, and soused
my well-brushed coat. I was once more number one!&mdash;all things
had changed again.</p>
<p>READER&mdash;Except the rainbow.</p>
<p>Ay, even that.</p>
<p>READER,&mdash;Indeed! how so?</p>
<p>If still impalpable to the gross foot of earth, it seemed to the
charmed mind a glowing passage for the freed spirit to mount to
bliss!</p>
<p>READER.&mdash;May I ask what caused this difference?</p>
<p>You may, and shall be answered. I had received&mdash;</p>
<p>READER.&mdash;What?</p>
<p class="cen">TWENTY POUNDS!</p>

<h2>CURIOSITY HUNTERS</h2>
<p>There is a large class of people in the world&mdash;the business
of whose lives is to hunt after and collect trifling curiosities;
who go about like the Parisian <em>chiffonniers</em>, grubbing and
poking in the highways and byeways of society, for those
dearly-prized objects which the generality of mankind would turn up
their noses at as worthless rubbish. But though the tribe of
curiosity-hunters be extremely numerous, Nature, by a wise
provision, has bestowed on them various appetites, so that, in the
pursuit of their prey, they are led by different instincts, and
what one seizes with avidity, another rejects as altogether
unworthy of notice.</p>
<p>The varieties of the species are interminable; some of them are
well known, and need no description&mdash;such as the book-worm,
the bird-stuffer, the coin-taster, the picture-scrubber, &amp;c.;
but there are others whose tastes are singularly eccentric: of
these I may mention the snuff-box collector, the cane-fancier, the
ring-taker, the play-bill gatherer, to say nothing of one
illustrious personage, whose passion for collecting a library of
Bibles is generally known. But there is another individual of the
species that I have not yet mentioned, whose morbid pleasure in
collecting relics and memorials of the most revolting deeds of
blood and crime is too well authenticated to be discredited. I
believe that this variety, which I term &ldquo;The Criminal
Curiosity Hunter,&rdquo; is unknown to every country in the world,
except England.</p>
<p>How such a horrible taste should have been engendered here, is a
question not easily solved. Physiologists are inclined to attribute
it to our heavy atmosphere, which induces gloomy thoughts and
fancies; while moralists assign as its cause, the sanguinary spirit
of our laws, our brutal exhibitions of hanging, drawing and
quartering, of gibbettings, whippings, brandings, and torturings,
which degrade men&rsquo;s natures, and give them a relish for
scenes of blood and cruelty.</p>
<p>It happened that I had occasion to call on one of those
&ldquo;Criminal Curiosity Hunters&rdquo; lately. He received me
with extreme urbanity, and pointing to an old-fashioned-looking
arm-chair, requested me to be seated.&mdash;I did so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose, sir,&rdquo; said he, with an air of suppressed
triumph, &ldquo;that you have no idea that you are now sitting in a
remarkable chair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I assured him I was totally unconscious of the fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can tell you, then,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that it
was in that chair Fauntleroy, the banker, who was hanged for
forgery, was sitting when he was arrested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fact, sir! I gave ten guineas for it. I thought also to
have obtained the night-cap in which he slept the night before his
execution, but another collector was beforehand with me, and bribed
the turnkey to steal it for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had no idea there could be any competition for such an
article,&rdquo; I observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! sir,&rdquo; said he, with a deep sigh, &ldquo;you
don&rsquo;t know the value of these interesting relics. I have been
for upwards of thirty years a collector of them, and I have now as
pretty a museum of Criminal Curiosities as you could desire to
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems you have been indefatigable in your
pursuit,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;when a man devotes himself
to a great object, he must go to it heart and soul. I have spared
neither time nor money in <em>my</em> pursuit; and since I became a
collector, I have attended the execution of every noted malefactor
throughout the kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perceiving that my attention was drawn to a common rope, which
served as a bell-pull, he said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you are remarking my bell-cord&mdash;that is the
identical rope, sir, which hanged Bellingham, who shot Mr. Perceval
in the House of Commons. I offered any sum for the one in which
Thistlewood ended his life to match it&mdash;but I was
unfortunately disappointed; and the laws have now become so
disgracefully lenient, that I fear I shall never have an
opportunity of procuring a respectable companion rope for the other
side of my mantel-piece. And &lsquo;tis all owing to the rascally
Whigs, sir&mdash;they have swept away all our good old English
customs, and deprived us of our national recreations. I remember,
sir, when Monday was called &lsquo;hanging day&rsquo; at the Old
Bailey; on that morning a man might he certain of seeing three or
four criminals swung off before his breakfast. &lsquo;Tis a curious
study, sir, that of hanging&mdash;I have seen a great many people
suffer in my time: some go off as quiet as lambs, while others die
very reluctantly. I have remarked, sir, that &lsquo;tis very
difficult to hang a Jew pedlar, or a
hackney-coachman&mdash;there&rsquo;s something obstinate in their
nature that won&rsquo;t let them die like other men. But, as I said
before, the Whigs and reformers have knocked up the hanging
profession; and if it was not for the suicides, which, I am happy
to say, are as abundant as ever, I don&rsquo;t know what we should
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After my friend&rsquo;s indignation against the anti-hanging
principles of Reform had subsided a little, he invited me to
examine his curiosities, which he had arranged in an adjoining
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not,&rdquo; said he, as we were proceeding
thither, &ldquo;confined my collection to objects connected with
capital offenders only; it comprehends relics of every grade of
crime, from murder to petty larceny. In that respect I am liberal,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had now reached the door of the apartment, when my conductor,
seizing my arm suddenly, pointed to the door-mat upon which I had
just set my foot, and said, &ldquo;Observe that mat, sir; it is
composed of oakum picked by the fair fingers of the late Lady
Barrymore, while confined in the Penitentiary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I cast a glance at this humble memorial of her late
ladyship&rsquo;s industry, and passed into the museum. In doing so,
I happened to stumble over a stable-bucket, which my friend
affirmed was the one from which Thurtell watered his horse on his
way to Probert&rsquo;s cottage. Opening a drawer, he produced a
pair of dirty-looking slippers, the authentic property of the
celebrated Ikey Solomons; and along with them a pair of cotton
hose, which he assured me he had mangled with his own hands in
Sarah Gale&rsquo;s mangle. In another drawer he directed my
attention to a short clay pipe, once in the possession of Burke;
and a tobacco-stopper belonging to Hare, the notorious murderer. He
had also preserved with great care Corder&rsquo;s advertisement for
a wife, written in his own hand, as it appeared in the weekly
papers, and a small fragment of a tile from the Red Barn, where
Maria Martin was murdered by the same Corder. He also possessed the
fork belonging to the knife with which some German, whose name I
forget, cut his wife&rsquo;s and children&rsquo;s throats; and a
pewter half-quartern measure, used at the Black Lion, in
Wych-street, by Sixteen-string Jack.</p>
<p>There were, likewise, in the collection several interesting
relics of humorous felony; such as the snuff-box of the Cock-lane
ghost&mdash;the stone thrown by Collins at William the
Fourth&rsquo;s head&mdash;a copy of Sir Francis Burden&rsquo;s
speech, for which he was committed to the Tower&mdash;an odd black
silk glove, worn by Mr. Cotton, the late ordinary of
Newgate&mdash;Barrington&rsquo;s silver tooth-pick&mdash;and a
stay-lace of Miss Julia Newman.</p>
<p>These were but a small portion of the contents of the museum;
but I had seen enough to make me sick of the exhibition, and I
withdrew with the firm resolution never again, during my life, to
enter the house of a <em>Criminal Curiosity Hunter</em>.</p>

<h3>ECCENTRICITIES OF THE MINOR DRAMA.</h3>
<p>We had intended to have arranged, for the use of future
syncretics, a system of coincidences, compiled from the plots of
those magnificent soul-stirring extravaganzas produced and acted at
the modern temples of the drama&mdash;the chaste Victoria&mdash;the
didactic Sadler&rsquo;s Wells&mdash;and the tramontane Pavilion:
but we have found the subject too vast for comprehension, and must
content ourselves with noting some of the more exorbitant and
refined instances of genius and hallucination displayed in those
mighty works. Among these the following are pre-eminent:&mdash;</p>
<p>It is a remarkable thing that mothers are always buried on the
tops of inaccessible mountains, and that, when it occurs to their
afflicted daughters to go and pray at their tombs, they generally
choose a particularly inclement night as best adapted for that
purpose. It is convenient, too, if any murder took place exactly on
the spot, exactly twenty years before, because in that case it is
something agreeable to reflect upon and allude to.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that people never lie down but to dream, and
that they always dream quite to the purpose, and immediately on
having done dreaming, they wake and act upon it.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that young men never know definitely whose sons
they are, and generally turn out to belong to the wrong father, and
find that they have been falling in love with their sisters, and
all that sort of thing.</p>
<p>N.B. Wanted, a new catastrophe for these incidents, as suicide
is going out of fashion.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that whenever people are in a particular hurry
to be off, they make a point of singing a song to put themselves in
spirits, and as an effectual method of concealing their presence
from their enemies, who are always close at hand with knives.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that things always go wrong until the last
scene, and then there is such hurry and bustle to get them right
again, that no one would ever believe it could be done in the time;
only they know it must be, and make up their minds to it
accordingly.</p>
<p>One word more. Like St. Dunstan&rsquo;s feet, which possessed
the sacred virtue of self-multiplication, and of which there
existed three at one time, it appears to be a prerogative of
epithets of the superlative degree to attach themselves to any
number of substantives. Thus the most popular comedian of the day
is five different men&mdash;the most beautiful drama ever produced
is two farces&mdash;an opera and a tragedy&mdash;and the most
decided hit in the memory of man is the &ldquo;Grecian
Statues&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The Wizard of the
Moon&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The Devil&rsquo;s
Daughter&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Martinuzzi&rdquo;&mdash;and &ldquo;The
Refuge for the Destitute.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE &ldquo;WELL-DRESSED&rdquo; AND THE
&ldquo;WELL-TO-DO.&rdquo;</h2>
<p>&ldquo;There has for the last few days been a smile on the face
<em>of every well-dressed gentleman</em>, and <em>of every
well-to-do artisan</em>, who wend their way along the streets of
this vast metropolis. It is caused by the opposition exhibition of
Friday night in the House of Commons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such is the comfortable announcement of a Tory morning
paper,&mdash;the very incarnation of spiteful imbecility. Such is
the self-complacency of the old Tory hag, that in her wildest
moments would bite excessively,&mdash;if she only had teeth. She
has, however, in the very simplicity of her smirking, let out the
whole secret&mdash;has, in the sweet serenity of her satisfaction,
revealed the selfishness, the wickedness of her creed. <em>Toryism
believes only in the well-dressed and the well-to-do</em>. Purple
and fine linen are the instrumental parts of her religion. She
subscribes, in fact, to forty-three points; four meals a day being
added to her Christian Thirty-nine Articles. Her faith is in glossy
raiment and a full belly. She has such a reverence for the loaves
and fishes, that in the fulness of her devotion, she would eat
them&mdash;as the author of the <em>Almanach des Gourmands</em>
advises the epicure to eat a certain exquisite
dainty&mdash;&ldquo;on her knees.&rdquo; She would die a martyr at
the fire;&mdash;but then it must be lighted in the kitchen.</p>
<p>The parliamentary exhibition which, according to the
<em>Sycorax</em> of Toryism&mdash;a <em>Sycorax</em> with double
malice, but no potency&mdash;has set all the well-dressed and
well-to-do part of &ldquo;this vast metropolis&rdquo; off in one
simultaneous simper, took place on the following motion made by Mr.
FIELDEN:&mdash;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Resolved,&mdash;That the distress of the
working people at the present time is so great through the country,
but particularly in the manufacturing districts, that it is the
duty of this House to make instant inquiry into the cause and
extent of such distress, and devise means to remedy it; and, at all
events, to vote no supply of money until such inquiry be
made.&rdquo;&mdash;(Hear, hear.)</p>
<p>This motion was negatived by 149 to 41; and it is to this
negative that, according to the avowal of our veracious
contemporary, we owe the radiant looks that have lighted up the
streets of London for the past few days. In the same sense of the
writer, but in the better words of the chorus of <em>Tom
Thumb</em>&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Nature seemed to wear a universal grin!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It being always premised and settled that the term nature only
comprehends the people with sleek coats and full stomachs. Nature
abhors a vacuum,&mdash;therefore has nought to do with empty
bellies. Happy are the men whose fate, or better philosophy, has
kept them from the turnips and the heather&mdash;fortunate mortals,
who, banned from the murder of partridges and grouse, have for the
last few days of our contemporary, been dwellers in merry London!
What exulting faces! What crowds of well-dressed, well-fed
<em>Malvolios</em>, &ldquo;smiling&rdquo; at one another, though
not cross-gartered! To a man prone to ponder on that many-leaved,
that scribbled, blurred and blotted volume, the human
face,&mdash;that mysterious tome printed with care, with cunning
and remorse,&mdash;that thing of lies, and miseries, and hypocritic
gladness,&mdash;that volume, stained with tears, and scribbled over
and over with daily wants, and daily sufferings, and daily
meannesses;&mdash;to such a reader who, from the hieroglyphic lines
of feigned content, can translate the haggard spirit and the pining
heart,&mdash;to such a man too often depressed and sickened by the
contemplation of the carnivorous faces thronging the streets of
London&mdash;faces that look as if they deemed the stream of all
human happiness flowed only from the Mint,&mdash;to such a man, how
great the satisfaction, how surpassing the enjoyment of these
&ldquo;last few days!&rdquo; As with the Thane of Cawdor, every
man&rsquo;s face has been a book; but, alas! luckier than
<em>Macbeth</em>, that book has been&mdash;<em>Joe Miller!</em></p>
<p>Every well-dressed gentleman has smiled, but then the source of
his satisfaction has been the rags fluttering on the human carcases
in the manufacturing districts. Every well-to-do artisan has wended
his way along the streets showing his teeth, but then at his own
sweet will he can employ those favoured instruments on roast or
boiled: hence his smile for those who, gifted with the like
weapons, bear them as men bear court swords, for ornament, not use.
Alas! the smirk of the well-dressed may be struck into blank
astonishment by the fluttering of rags&mdash;by a standard of
tatters borne by a famine-maddened myriad; the teeth of the dragon
want may be sown, and the growth may, as of old, be armed men.</p>
<p>Yet can we wonder at the jocoseness of those arrayed in lawn and
broad-cloth&mdash;can we marvel at the simper of the artisan fresh
from his beef and pudding, solaced with tobacco and porter? Surely
not; for the smile breaks under the highest patronage; nay, even
broad grins would have the noblest warranty, for his Grace the Duke
of Wellington has pronounced rags to be the livery only of wilful
idleness&mdash;has stamped on the withering brow of destitution the
brand of the drunkard. Therefore, clap your hands to your pulpy
sides, oh well-dressed, well-to-do London, and disdaining the
pettiness of a simper, laugh an ogre&rsquo;s laugh at the rags of
Manchester&mdash;grin like a tickled Polyphemus at the hunger of
Bolton!</p>
<p>Our babbling, anile friend, in the very looseness of her prating
has let out the truth. Or rather&mdash;a common custom with
her&mdash;she has talked in her sleep. Her very weakness has,
however, given a point to her revelation.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Diamonds dart their brightest lustre,</p>
<p><em>from a palsy-shaken head</em>!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the midst of her snores she has but revealed the plot entered
into between those most respectable conspirators, Broad Cloth and
Beef, against those old offenders, those incorrigible miscreants,
Rags and Want! The confederacy is, to be sure, older than the
crucified thieves; but then it has not been so undisguisedly
avowed. Broad Cloth has, on the contrary, affected a sympathy with
tatters, though with a constancy of purpose has refused an ell from
its trailing superfluity to solace the wretchedness; the tears of
Beef dropt on the lank abdomen of Starvation, are ancient as post
diluvian crocodiles.&mdash;but it has spared no morsel to the
object of its hypocritic sorrow. Now, however, even the decency of
deceit is to be dropt, and Broad Cloth is to make sport with the
nakedness of the land, and merry Beef is to roar like the bulls of
Bashan at the agonies of famine!</p>
<p>As the winter approaches we are promised increasing sources of
amusement from the manufacturing districts. What sunny faces will
break though the fogs of November&mdash;what giggling will drown
the cutting blasts of January! Eschewing the wise relaxation of
pantomimes, we shall be taught to consult the commercial reports in
the newspapers as the highest and fullest source of salutary
laughter. How we shall simper when mills are stopped&mdash;how crow
with laughter when whole factories are silent and deserted! How
reader&mdash;(for we acknowledge none who are not well-dressed and
well-to-do)&mdash;how you will scream with joy when banks
break!&mdash;and how consult the list of bankrupts as the very
spirit and essence of the most consummate fun. Insolvency shall
henceforth be synonymous with repartee&mdash;and compositions with
creditors practical <em>bons mots</em>.</p>
<p>Oh! reader&mdash;(but mind, you <em>must</em>, we say, to be our
reader, be well-dressed and well-to-do; for though we owe the very
paper beneath your eye to rags, we trust we are sufficiently in the
mode to laugh contemptuously at such abominations)&mdash;oh!
reader, quit your lighter recreations; seek not for merriment in
fictitious humour; it is a poor, unsatisfactory diet, weak and
watery; but find substantial drollery from the fluttering of
tatters&mdash;laugh, and with the crowing joy, grow sleek and lusty
at the writhings and the lamentations of want!</p>
<p>We have, however, a recent benevolent instance of the political
and social power of dress&mdash;an instance gathered from the Court
of Spain. The organ (or rather barrel-organ of Toryism, for it has
only a set number of tunes) which played our opening quotation,
also grinds the following:&mdash;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;The Regent Espartero, and the tutor
Arguelles, are doing all in their power to keep the young Queen and
the Infanta <em>in good humour</em>, encouraging the Princesses in
many little indulgences suitable to their age and sex,
<em>especially in the article of dress</em>, in which their royal
mother was more than inattentive. <em>This line of conduct</em>,
coupled with the expected arrival of the Infant, Don Francisco de
Paula and his family, who are to be received with every mark of
respect, indicates that the present rulers of Spain, aware of their
critical situation, wish to strengthen themselves by the support of
the great majority of the royal family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus, if the royal family of Spain have an excess of courtesy
and benevolence towards the people, such blessings will drop upon
them from the fringed petticoats of the little sovereign. Thus
curiously considered, may we not trace a bounteous political
measure to the lace veil of a Queen, and find a great national
benefit in the toe of a slipper?</p>
<p>Happy Spaniards! Give fine clothes to <em>your</em> rulers, and
they yearn with benevolence towards the donors. <em>They</em> do
not walk about the streets of Madrid, smiling in the strength of
their wardrobe at the nakedness of those who have subscribed the
bravery. Oh, ye &ldquo;well-dressed gentlemen,&rdquo; and oh, ye
&ldquo;well-to-do artisans!&rdquo;&mdash;be instructed by the new
petticoats of Queen Isabella, and smile no at rags and famine.</p>

<h2>TRANSACTIONS OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF
HOOKHAM-CUM-SNIVEY.</h2>
<p>There is not a more interesting science than geology, which, as
our readers are aware, treats principally of mud and minerals. The
association at Hookham-cum-Snivey has been very active during the
summer, and may be said to have been up to its knees in dirt and
filth, gravel and gypsum, coal, clay and conglomerate, for a very
considerable period.</p>
<p>It having been determined to open a sewer where the old
Hookham-road meets with the ancient Roman footpath at Snivey, the
junction of which gives name to the modern town, the Geological
Association passed a strong resolution, in which it was asserted,
that the opportunity had at length arrived for solving the great
doubt that had long perplexed the minds of the inhabitants as to
whether the soil in the neighbourhood was crustaceous or
carboniferous. The <em>crusta</em>ceous party had been long
triumphing in the fact, that a mouldy piece of bread had been found
at two feet below the surface, when digging for the foundation of a
swing erected in a garden in the neighbourhood; but the
<em>carboni</em>ferous enthusiasts had been thrown into ecstacies,
by the sexton having come upon a regular <em>strata</em> of
undoubted cinders, in clearing out a piece of ground at the back of
the parson&rsquo;s residence. Some evil-disposed persons had the
malice to say that the spot had been formerly the site of a
subsequently-filled-up dusthole; but the <em>crusta</em>ceous
party, depending as they did upon a single piece of
bread&mdash;<em>all crumb</em> too&mdash;however genuine, could not
be said to have so much to go upon as the <em>carboni</em>ferous
section, with their heap of cinders, the latter being large in
quantity, though of doubtful authority.</p>
<p>However, the opening of the sewer was looked forward to with
intense interest, as being calculated to decide the great question,
and all the principal geologists were on the spot several hours
before operations commenced, for the purpose of inspecting the
surface of the ground before it was disturbed by the spade and
pickaxe of the labourer.</p>
<p>It was found that the earth consisted of an outer coat of dust,
amongst which were several stones, varying in size, with here and
there a bone picked exceedingly clean, and evidently belonging to a
sheep; all of which facts gave promise of most gratifying results
to the true lover of geology. At length the labourer came in sight,
and was greeted with loud cheers from the crustaceous party, which
were ironically echoed by the disciples of the carboniferous
school, and a most significant &ldquo;hear, hear,&rdquo; proceeded
from an active partisan of the latter class, when the first stroke
of the pickaxe proclaimed the commencement of an operation upon
which so much was known to depend for the interests of geology. The
work had proceeded for some time amid breathless interest,
interrupted only by sneers, cheers, jeers, and cries of &ldquo;Oh,
oh!&rdquo; or &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; As the throwing up of a
shovelful of earth excited the hopes of one party, or the fears of
the other, when a hard substance was struck upon, which caused a
thrilling sensation among the bystanders. The pressure of the
geologists, all eager to inspect the object that had created so
much curiosity, could hardly be restrained, and the president was
thrown, with great violence, into the hole that had been dug, from
which he was pulled with extraordinary strength of body, and
presence of mind, by the honorary treasurer.</p>
<p>The hard substance was found to consist of a piece of iron, of
which it appeared a vein, or rather an artery, ran both backwards
and forwards from the spot where it was first discovered. The
confusion was at its height, for it was supposed a mine had been
discovered, and a long altercation ensued; the town-clerk claiming
it in the name of the lord of the manor, while the beadle, with a
confused idea about mines being royal property, leaped into the
hole, and, in the Queen&rsquo;s name, took possession of
everything. A desperate struggle ensued, in which several
geologists were laid straight upon the <em>strata</em>, and were
converted into secondary deposits on the surface of the earth; when
the lamplighter, coming by, recognised the hard iron substance as
the large main of the Equitable Company. It became therefore
necessary to relinquish any further investigation on the spot
originally chosen, and the matter was postponed to another day, so
that the great crustaceous and carboniferous question remains
exactly where it did, to the great injury of the harmony and good
feeling that has never yet prevailed, though it is hoped it some
time or other may prevail, among the inhabitants.</p>
<p>But though public investigation of geological truth is for a
time at a stand-still, we are glad to be able to record the
following remarkable instance of private enterprise:&mdash;</p>
<p>A very active member of the association&mdash;the indefatigable
Mr. Grubemup&mdash;determined to leave no stone unturned for the
purpose of making observations, went out, attended by a single
assistant, and made a desperate attempt to turn the mile-stone in
the Kensington-road, in the hope of finding some geological facts
at the bottom of it. After several hours&rsquo; labour before
day-break, to avoid interruption from the police, he succeeded in
introducing the point of a pickaxe beneath the base of the stone;
and eventually he had the satisfaction of removing it from its
position, when he made the following geological
observations:&mdash;He found a primary deposit of dark soil, and,
on putting his spectacles to his eyes, he distinctly detected a
common worm in a state of high salubrity. This clearly proved to
him that there must formerly have been a direct communication
between Hookham-cum-Snivey and the town of Kensington, for the worm
found beneath the milestone exactly resembled one now in the
Hookham-cum-Snivey Museum, and which is known as the <em>vermis
communis</em>, or earth-worm, and which has always excited
considerable interest among the various visitors. Mr. Grubemup,
encouraged by this highly satisfactory result, proceeded to scratch
up with his thumb-nail a portion of the soil, and his geological
enterprise was speedily rewarded by a fossil of the most
interesting character. Upon close inspection it proved to be a
highly crystallised rat&rsquo;s-tail, from which the geologist
inferred that there were rats on the Kensington-road at a much
earlier period than milestones. We have not heard that the
ingenious gentleman carried his examination further, but in the
present state of geology, any contribution to the science, however
small, will be thankfully received by the knowledge-loving
community.</p>

<h3>METROPOLITAN IMPROVEMENTS.</h3>
<p>It is at length decided that Aldgate pump is to be painted, but
the vestry have not yet determined what the colour is to be. It is
thought, to suit the diversity of opinions in the parish cabinet,
that it will be painted in a harlequin pattern.</p>
<p>It is seriously contemplated to attempt the removal of the
ancient &ldquo;Hot Codlings&rdquo; stand from the west-end of
Temple Bar. The old woman who at present occupies the premises is
resolved to resist to the utmost so unjust an aggression.</p>
<p>The Corporation of the City of London have, in the most liberal
manner, given a plot of ground, eighteen by thirteen and a
half-inches, for the erection of a pickled whilks and pennywinkle
establishment, at the corner of Newgate-street and the Old Bailey.
This will be a valuable boon to the Blue-coat boys, and will tend
to cause a brisk influx of loose coppers to this hitherto
much-neglected spot.</p>
<p>The disgraceful state of the gutter-grating in Little
Distaff-lane has, at length, awakened the attention of the parish
authorities. For several days past it has been choked by an
accumulation of rubbish, but we are now enabled, on good authority,
to state that the parish-beadle has been directed to poke it with
his staff, which it is hoped will have the effect of removing the
obstruction.</p>
<p>The Commissioners of Woods and Forests have ordered plans and
estimates to be laid before them for the erection of a duck-house
on the island of the pond in St. James&rsquo;s Park.</p>
<p>It has been decided that the exhibition of fancy paper on the
boards of the enclosure of Trafalgar-square is to continue open to
the public till further notice.</p>

<p><span class="hide">O</span>ur lively neighbours on the opposite
side of the <em>Pas de Calais</em> (as they are pleased, in a
spirit of patriotic appropriation, to translate the Straits of
Dovor), have lately shot off a flight of small literary rockets
about Paris, which have exploded joyously in every direction,
producing all sorts of fun and merriment, termed <em>Les
Physiologies</em>&mdash;a series of graphic sketches, embodying
various every-day types of characters moving in the French capital.
In the same spirit we beg to bring forward the following papers,
with the hope that they will meet with an equally favourable
reception.</p>
<h4>1. THE INTRODUCTORY DISCOURSE.</h4>
<p>We are about to discuss a subject as critical and important to
take up as the abdominal aorta; for should we offend the class we
are about to portray, there are fifteen hundred medical students,
arrived this week in London, ripe and ready to avenge themselves
upon our devoted cranium, which, although hardened throughout its
ligneous formation by many blows, would not be proof against their
united efforts. And we scarcely know how or where to begin. The
instincts and different phases, under which this interesting race
appears, are so numerous, that far from complaining of the paucity
of materials we have to work upon, we are overwhelmed by mental
suggestions, and rapidly-dissolving views, of the various classes
from Guy&rsquo;s to the London University, from St. George&rsquo;s
to the London Hospital, perpetually crowding upon our brains (if we
have any), and rendering our ideas as completely muddled as those
of a &ldquo;new man&rdquo; who has, for the first week of October,
attended every single lecture in the day, from the commencement of
chemistry, at nine in the morning, to the close of surgery, at
eight in the evening. Lecture! auspicious word! we have a beginning
prompted by the mere sound. We will address you, medical students,
according to the style you are most accustomed to.</p>
<p>Gentlemen,&mdash;Your attention is to be this morning directed
to an important part of your course on physiology, which your
various professors, at two o&rsquo;clock on Saturday afternoon,
will separately tell you is derived from two Greek words, so that
we have no occasion to explain its meaning at present. Magendie,
M&uuml;ller, Mayo, Millengen, and various other M&rsquo;s, have
written works upon physiology, affecting the human race generally;
you are now requested to listen to the demonstration of one species
in particular&mdash;the Medical Student of London.</p>
<p>Lay aside your deeper studies, then, and turn for a while to our
lighter sketches; forget the globules of the blood in the
contemplation of red billiard balls; supplant the <em>tunica
arachnoidea</em> of the brain by a gossamer hat&mdash;the <em>rete
mucosum</em> of the skin by a pea-jacket; the vital fluid by a pot
of half-and-half. Call into play the flexor muscles of your arms
with boxing-gloves and single-sticks; examine the secreting glands
in the shape of kidneys and sweetbreads; demonstrate other theories
connected with the human economy in an equally analogous and
pleasant manner; lay aside your crib Celsus and Steggall&rsquo;s
Manual for our own more enticing pages, and find your various
habits therein reflected upon paper, with a truth to nature only
exceeded by the artificial man of the same material in the Museum
of King&rsquo;s College. Assume for a time all this joyousness.
PUNCH has entered as a pupil at a medical school (he is not at
liberty to say which), on purpose to note your propensities, and
requests you for a short period to look upon him as one of your own
lot. His course will commence next week, and &ldquo;The New
Man&rdquo; will be the subject.</p>

<h3>MICHAELMAS DAY</h3>
<p>Every one knows that about this time of the year geese are in
their prime, and are particularly good when stuffed with sage;
which accounts for the fact, that Sibthorp has made some sage
remarks, so that he may not lose by comparison with the
&ldquo;foolish birds,&rdquo; with whom he feels a natural
sympathy.</p>
<p>We have never been able to discover the connexion between geese
and Michaelmas. There is a reason for associating ducks with
Midsummer: we can understand the meaning of poultry at Christmas,
for <em>birds</em> are appropriate to a period when every one sends
in <em>his bill</em>; but why poor St. Michael should be so
degradingly associated with a goose is beyond our comprehension,
and baffles our ingenuity. If St. Michael had been a tailor, or an
actor, or an author, we could have understood how <em>goose</em>
might have applied to him; but as he was neither one nor the other,
we really are at a loss to conceive why a goose should have become
so intimately associated with his name and character.</p>
<p>Among other curious incidents, it may be remarked that, with an
instinctive dread of <em>goose</em>, the redoubtable
<em>Martinuzzi</em> drew in his horns, just on the eve of
Michaelmas, and the <em>Syncretics</em> have just shut up shop in
time to avoid the &ldquo;<em>compliments of the season</em>&rdquo;
that they had every right and every reason to anticipate would be
bestowed, if not with a &ldquo;liberal hand,&rdquo; at least with
&ldquo;a lavish mouth,&rdquo; by their audience.</p>
<p>It must be remembered by all the geese against whom PUNCH thinks
proper to indulge his wit, that at this season of the year they
must expect to be roasted. Upon the whole, however, we have a high
respect for &ldquo;the foolish bird,&rdquo; and when it is
remembered that the geese saved Rome, we do not think we are wrong
in suggesting the possibility of England being yet saved by Lord
Coventry, or any other cackler in either house of Parliament.</p>

<h3>&ldquo;LAND SHARKS AND SEA GULLS.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Admiral Napier observed that &ldquo;retired lawyers got better
paid than retired admirals.&rdquo; A gross injustice, as their
vocations bear an extraordinary similarity; par example&mdash;both
are <em>attach&eacute;s</em> of the Fleet: in an action, both know
the necessity of being bailed out to prevent swamping. One service
is distinguished by its &ldquo;davits,&rdquo; the other by its
&ldquo;affidavits;&rdquo; and they are mutually and equally admired
for, and known by, their craft. The only difference between them
being, that the lawyer serves &ldquo;two masters&rdquo;&mdash;the
admiral, invariably, three masters. If the same remark applies to
the members of the army-list, as well as to those of the navy and
law, we must say that it is an extremely shabby method of</p>

<h3>AFFAIRS IN CHINA.</h3>
<h4>PRIVATE LETTER FROM A YOUNG OFFICER AT THE ENGLISH FACTORY,
CANTON, TO HIS BROTHER IN ENGLAND.</h4>
<p>DEAR TOM,&mdash;Everything is going on gloriously&mdash;the
British arms are triumphant&mdash;and we now only require the
Emperor of China&rsquo;s consent to our taking possession of his
territory, which I am sorry to say there is at present no
likelihood of obtaining. However, there is little doubt, if we be
not all swept off by ague and cholera, that we shall be able to
maintain our present position a few months longer. Our situation
here would be very comfortable if we had anything to eat, except
bad beef and worse biscuit; these, however, are but trifling
inconveniences; and though we have no fresh meat, we have plenty of
fish in the river. One of our men caught a fine one the other day,
which was bought and cooked for the officers&rsquo; mess, by which
means we were all nearly destroyed&mdash;the fish unfortunately
happening to be of a poisonous nature; in consequence of which a
general order was issued the next day, forbidding the troops to
catch or eat any more fish. The country around the factory is
beautiful; but we deem it prudent to keep within the walls, as the
Chinese are very expert at picking up stragglers, whom they usually
strangle. Beyond this we cannot complain of our situation; fowls
are extremely abundant, but I have not seen any, the inhabitants
having carried them up the country along with their cattle and
provisions of every description. The water here is so brackish that
it is almost impossible to drink it; there are, however some wells
of delicious water in the neighbourhood, which would be a real
treasure to us if the Chinese had not poisoned them.
Notwithstanding these unavoidable privations, the courage of our
troops is indomitable; a detachment of the &mdash;&mdash;th
regiment succeeded last week in taking possession of an island in
the river, nearly half an acre in extent; it has, however, since
been deemed advisable to relinquish this important conquest, owing
to the muddy nature of the soil, into which several of our brave
fellows sank to the middle, and were with difficulty extricated. A
gallant affair took place a few days ago between two English
men-of-war&rsquo;s boats and a Chinese market junk, which was taken
after a resolute defence on the part of the Chinaman and his wife,
who kept up a vigorous fire of pumpkins and water-melons upon our
boats, until their supply was exhausted, when they were forced to
surrender to British valour. The captured junk has since been cut
up for the use of the forces. Though this unpleasant state of
affairs has interrupted all formal intercourse between the Chinese
and English, Captain Elliot has given a succession of balls to the
occupants of a small mud fort near the shore, which I fear they did
not relish, as several of them appeared exceedingly hurt, and
removed with remarkable celerity out of reach of the
Captain&rsquo;s civilities. Thus, instead of opening the trade,
this proceeding has only served to open the breach. The Emperor, I
hear, is enraged at our successes, and has ordered the head and
tail of the mandarin, Keshin, to be sent in pickle to the imperial
court at Pekin. A new mandarin has arrived, who has presented a
chop to Captain Elliott, but I hope, where there is so much at
stake, that he will not be put off with a chop. There is no
description of tea to be had in the market now but gunpowder,
which, by the last reports, is going off briskly. Our amusements
are not very numerous, being chiefly confined to yawning and
sleeping; of this latter recreation I must confess that we enjoy
but little, owing to the mosquitos, who are remarkably active and
persevering in their attacks upon us. But with the exception of
these tormenting insects, and a rather alarming variety of
centipedes, scorpions, and spiders, we have no venomous creatures
to disturb us. The weather is extremely hot, and the advantages of
the river for bathing would be very great if it were not so full of
sharks. I have much more to relate of our present cheering
prospects and enviable situation, but a ship is on the point of
sailing for England, so must conclude in haste.</p>
<p class="rgt">Ever, dear Tom, yours,<br />
R.B.</p>

<h3>POACHED EGOTISM.</h3>
<p>The <em>Examiner</em> observes, in speaking of the types of the
new premier&rsquo;s policy,&mdash;&ldquo;The state, I am the
state,&rdquo; said the most arrogant of French monarchs. &ldquo;The
administration, I am the administration,&rdquo; would seem to say
Sir Robert Peel. In the speech explanatory of his views, which
cannot be likened to Wolsey&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>Ego et Rex
meus</em>,&rdquo; because the importance of the <em>ego</em> is not
impaired by any addition.&mdash;This literally amounts to a
conviction, on the part of the editor of the <em>Examiner</em>,
that the premier&rsquo;s expression is all in his

<p>MR. WAKLEY begs to inform the Lords of the Treasury, the editor
of the <em>Times</em>, and the Master of the Mint, that ever
anxious to rise in the world, he has recently been induced to
undertake the sweeping of Conservative flues, and the performance
of any dirty work which his Tory patrons may deem him worthy to

<h3>THE POETICAL JUSTICE.</h3>
<p>SIR PETER LAURIE, in commenting upon the late case of false
imprisonment, where two young men had been unjustifiably handcuffed
by the police, delivered himself of the following exquisite piece
of rhetoric:&mdash;&ldquo;He did not think it possible that such a
case of abuse could pass unnoticed as that he had just heard. The
general conduct of the police was, he believed, good; but the
instances of arbitrary conduct and overbearing demeanour <em>set to
flight all the ancient examples brought forward to enrich by
contrast the serious parts of the glorious genius of
Shakspeare</em>.&rdquo; We never understood or imagined there was
an Anacreon among the aldermen, a Chaucer in the common council, or
a Moliere at the Mansion-house. We have now discovered the Peter
Lauriate of the City&mdash;the poet of the Poultry. Who, in the
face of the above sentence, can deny his right to these titles, if,
like ourselves, they are</p>

<h2>PUNCH&rsquo;S THEATRE.</h2>
<h3>WHAT WILL THE WORLD SAY?</h3>
<p>The family of the &ldquo;Sponges&rdquo; distributes itself over
the entire face of society&mdash;its members are familiar with
almost every knocker, and with nearly everybody&rsquo;s
dinner-hour. They not unfrequently come in with the eggs, and only
go out with the last glass of negus. They seem to possess the power
of ubiquity; for, go where you will, your own especial sponge (and
everybody with more than two hundred a-year has one), is sure to
present himself. He is ready for anything, especially where eating,
love, duelling, or drinking, is concerned. To oblige you, he will
breakfast at supper-time, or sup at breakfast-time; he will drink
any given quantity, at any time, and will carry any number of
declarations of love to any number of ladies, or of challenges to
whole armies of rivals: thus far he is useful; for he is obliging,
and will do anything&mdash;but pay.</p>
<p>When he has absorbed all the moisture his victims are able to
supply, he may be seen walking about in moody solitude in the
parks, where he sponges upon the ducks, and owes for the use of the
chairs. In this dry and destitute condition, behold the sponge of
the Covent-Garden Comedy&mdash;<em>Captain Tarradiddle</em>. He is
in St. James&rsquo; Park; for, possessing imaginary rather than
substantial claims to military rank, he flits about the
Horse-Guards to keep up his character. A person is already upon the
stage, for whom you instinctively shudder&mdash;you perceive, at
once, that he is &ldquo;in&rdquo; for dinner, wine, theatre, and
supper&mdash;you pity him; you see the sponge, speciously, but
surely, fasten himself upon his victim like a vampire. <em>Mr. Pye
Hilary</em>, being a barrister and a man of the world, resigns
himself, however, to his fate. As to shaking off his leech, he
knows that to be impossible; and he determines to make what use of
him he can. There is a fine opportunity, for <em>Mr. Pye
Hilary</em> is in love, in despair, and in waiting: he expects his
mistress&rsquo;s abigail; in negociating with whom, he conceives
<em>Tarradiddle</em> will be a valuable assistant. <em>Mrs.
Tattle</em> arrives. Preliminaries having been duly settled,
articles offensive and defensive are entered into, to carry out a
plan by which the lover shall gain an interview with the mistress;
and the treaty is ratified by a liberal donation, which the
<em>Captain</em> makes to the maid out of his friend&rsquo;s purse.
The servant is satisfied, and goes off in the utmost agitation, for
<em>Miss Mayley</em> and her guardian are coming; and she dreads
being caught in the fact of bribery. <em>Mr. Hilary</em> trembles;
so does the young lady, when she appears; and the agitation of all
parties is only put an end to by the fall of the act-drop.</p>
<p>If any class of her Majesty&rsquo;s subjects are more miserable
than another, it is that of gentlemen&rsquo;s servants. One of
these oppressed persons is revealed to us in the next act. Poor
fellow! he has nothing to do but to sit in the hall, and nothing to
amuse him but the newspaper. But his misfortunes do not end here:
as if to add insult to injury, the family governess presumes to
upbraid him, and actually insists upon his taking a letter to the
post. <em>Mr. Nibble</em> declines performing so undignified a
service, in the most footman-like terms; but unfortunately, as it
generally happens, in families where there are pretty governesses
and gallant sons, <em>Miss de Vere</em> has a protector in the
<em>Hon. Charles Norwold</em>, who overhears her unreasonable
demand, and with a degree of injustice enough to make the entire
livery of London rave with indignation, inflicts upon his
father&rsquo;s especial livery, and <em>Nibble&rsquo;s</em>
illustrious person, a severe caning. The consequence of this
&ldquo;strike&rdquo; is, that <em>Nibble</em> gives warning,
<em>Lord</em> and <em>Lady Norwold</em> are paralysed at this
important resignation; for by it they discover that a secret
coalition has taken place between their son and the
governess&mdash;they are man and wife! Good heavens! the heir of
all the Norwolds marry a teacher, who has nothing to recommend her
but virtue, talent, and beauty! Monstrous!&mdash;&ldquo;What will
the world say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The treaty formed between <em>Mistress Tattle</em> and <em>Mr.
Pye Hilary</em> is in the next act being acted upon. We behold
<em>Captain Tarradiddle</em>, as one of the high contracting
parties&rsquo; ambassador, taking lodgings in a house exactly
opposite to that in which <em>Miss Mayley</em> resides. Of course
nothing so natural as that the Captain should indulge his friend
with a visit for a few days, or, if possible, for a few weeks. It
is also natural that the host, under the circumstances, should wish
to know something of the birth, parentage, and education of his
guest, of which, though an old acquaintance; he is, as yet,
entirely ignorant. Now, if it be possible to affront a real sponge
(but there is nothing more difficult), such inquiries are likely to
produce that happy consummation. <em>Tarradiddle</em>, however,
gets over the difficulty with the tact peculiar to his class, and
is fortunately interrupted by the announcement that <em>Tattle</em>
is in the parlour, duly keeping her agreement, by bringing her
mistress&rsquo;s favourite canary, which, having flown away quite
by accident, under her guidance, has chosen to perch in
<em>Hilary&rsquo;s</em> new lodging, on purpose to give him the
opportunity of returning it, and of obtaining an interview with
<em>Miss Mayley</em>. The expedient succeeds in the next scene; the
lover bows and stammers&mdash;as lovers do at first
interviews&mdash;the lady is polite but dignified, and
<em>Tarradiddle</em>, who has been angling for an invitation, has
his hopes entirely put to flight by the entrance of the
lady&rsquo;s guardian, <em>Mr. Warner</em>, who very promptly cuts
matters short by ringing the bell and saying &ldquo;Good
evening,&rdquo; in that tone of voice which always intimates a
desire for a good riddance. This hint is too broad ever to be
mistaken; so the sponge and his victim back out.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Warner</em> is a merchant, and all merchants in plays
are the &ldquo;noblest characters the world can boast,&rdquo; and
very rich. Thus it has happened that <em>Warner</em> has, through a
money-agent, one <em>Grub</em>, been enabled to lend, at various
times, large sums of money, to <em>Lady Norwold</em>&mdash;her
ladyship being one of those who, dreading &ldquo;what will the
world say?&rdquo; is by no means an economist, and prefers
&ldquo;ruin to retrenchment.&rdquo; As security for these loans,
the lady deposits her jewels, suite by suite, till the great object
of all <em>Warner&rsquo;s</em> advances gets into his
possession&mdash;namely, a bracelet, which is a revered relic of
the Norwold family. So far <em>Warner</em>, in spite of a
troublesome ward, and his late visitors, is happy; but he soon
receives a letter, which puts his happiness to flight. His
daughter, who has been on a visit in Paris, became, he now learns,
united some months before, to <em>Charles Norwold</em>, and a
governess in his father&rsquo;s family. By further inquiries, he
learns that the son is discarded, and is, with his wife, consigned
to beggary, for fear of&mdash;&ldquo;what will the world
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fourth act exhibits one of the scenes of human life hitherto
veiled from the eyes of the most prying&mdash;a genuine specimen of
the sponge species&mdash;at home! Actually living under a roof that
he calls his own; in company with a wife who is certainly nobody
else&rsquo;s. She is ironing&mdash;<em>Tarradiddle</em> is smoking,
and, like all smokers, philosophising. Here we learn the
<em>Honourable Charles Norwold</em> and his wife have taken
lodgings; hither they are pursued by <em>Hilary</em>, who has
managed to ingratiate himself with <em>Warner</em>, and undertaken
to trace the merchant&rsquo;s lost daughter; here, to
<em>Pye&rsquo;s</em> astonishment, he finds his friend and sponge.
Some banter ensues, not always agreeable to the Captain, but all
ends very pleasantly by the entrance of <em>Warner</em>, who
discovers his daughter, and becomes a father-in-law with a good
grace.</p>
<p>The denouement is soon told:&mdash;<em>Warner</em>, having
received his daughter and her husband, gives a party at which
<em>Lady</em>, and afterwards <em>Lord Norwold</em>, are present.
Here Warner&rsquo;s anxiety to obtain the bracelet is explained. He
reminds his lordship that he once accused his elder brother of
stealing that very bauble; and the consequence was, that the
accused disappeared, and was never after heard of. <em>Warner</em>
avows himself to be that brother, but declines disturbing the
rights or property of his lordship, if he will again receive his
son. This is, of course, done. <em>Hilary</em> jokes himself into
<em>Miss Mayley&rsquo;s</em> good graces, and <em>Tarradiddle</em>,
in all the glories of a brown coat, and an outrageously fine
waistcoat, enters to make the scene complete, and to help to speak
the tag, in which all the characters have a hand; Mrs. Glover
ending by making a propitiatory appeal to the audience in favour of
the author, who ought to be very grateful to her for the
captivating tones in which she asked for an affirmative answer to
the question&mdash;</p>

<h3>SIBTHORPIANA.</h3>
<p>A clergyman was explaining to the gallant officer the meaning of
the phrase &ldquo;born again;&rdquo; but it was quite
unintelligible to Sib., who remarked that he knew no one who could
<em>bear</em> him even once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you read the notice to correspondents in PUNCH?&rdquo;
quoth Sib.&mdash;&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; replied Hardinge, &ldquo;and I
wonder people should send them such
trash.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; retorted the
punster&mdash;&ldquo;Pooh! you know that wherever PUNCH is to be
found, there are always plenty of <em>spoons</em> after
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonder you&rsquo;re not drunk,&rdquo; said
Sibthorp to Wieland&mdash;&ldquo;a great wonder, because&mdash;do
you give it up?&mdash;Because you&rsquo;re <em>a tumbler full of
spirits</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CURIOUS AMBIGUITY.</h3>
<p>The correspondent of a London paper, writing from Sunderland
respecting the report that Lord Howick had been fired at by some
ruffian, says, with great <em>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</em>, &ldquo;a
gun was certainly pointed at his lordship&rsquo;s head, but it is
generally believed there was nothing in it.&rdquo;&mdash;We confess
we are at a loss to know whether the facetious writer alludes to
the <em>gun</em> or the <em>head</em>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>THE THORNY PREMIER.</h3>
<p>A Tory evening paper tells its readers that Sir Robert Peel
expects a harassing opposition from the late ministry, but that he
is prepared for them on <em>all points</em>. This reminds us of the
defensive expedient of the hedgehog, which, conscious of its
weakness, rolls itself into a ball, to be prepared for its
assailants on <em>all points</em>.</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
